## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring following formats:

-   HTML

-   PDF

-   MS Word

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

For more details on using R Markdown click [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Penguin Plots: Practice analysis

## Setting up environment

Notes: setting up my R environment by loading `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages:

```{r loading packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Loading and cleanig the data

```{r preparing data}
data(penguins)
penguins_clean <- penguins %>%
  drop_na()
```

## Creating scatter plot

```{r creating scatter plot}
ggplot(data = penguins_clean) +
  geom_point(
   mapping = aes(
     x = flipper_length_mm,
     y = body_mass_g,
     color = sex
   )
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguins",
    x = "Flipper lenght (mm)",
    y = "Body mass (g)"
  )
```
